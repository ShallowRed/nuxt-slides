# Swiss Typography

The International Typographic Style

## Design Principles

### Clarity Through Structure

The Swiss design movement, born in the 1950s, revolutionized visual communication through:

- **Grid-based layouts** — Mathematical precision in composition
- **Sans-serif typography** — Helvetica as the ultimate expression
- **Asymmetric balance** — Dynamic yet harmonious arrangements
- **Objective photography** — Reality over illustration

> Good design is as little design as possible.
> — Dieter Rams

### The Grid System

::TwoColumns

#### Purpose
The grid provides structure without sacrificing creativity. It creates visual rhythm and guides the eye naturally through content.

#### Application
1. Establish consistent margins
2. Define column widths
3. Align all elements to the grid
4. Use white space intentionally

::

## Code Example

### Clean, Functional Code

```javascript
const swissDesign = {
  typography: 'Helvetica Neue',
  colors: ['#000000', '#ffffff', '#e63946'],
  principles: [
    'Clarity',
    'Objectivity', 
    'Universality'
  ]
};
```

## Summary

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Clarity | Strong hierarchy, ample white space |
| Objectivity | Sans-serif fonts, neutral colors |
| Grid | Mathematical, consistent layouts |
| Reduction | Remove unnecessary decoration |
